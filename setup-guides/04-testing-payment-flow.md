# üß™ STEP 4: Testing Payment Flow

## 4.1 Pre-Testing Setup

### Required Information Before Testing:
1. ‚úÖ Razorpay test credentials from dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Environment variables configured
3. ‚úÖ Backend server implemented
4. ‚úÖ Frontend payment integration ready

### Update .env with Your Test Credentials:
```env
# Replace these with your actual test credentials from Razorpay dashboard
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_actual_key_id_here
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_actual_key_secret_here
REACT_APP_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_actual_key_id_here
```

## 4.2 Start the Development Environment

### Terminal 1 - Start Backend Server:
```bash
cd e:\Chiksha\Chakshi
npm run server:dev
```

### Terminal 2 - Start React App:
```bash
cd e:\Chiksha\Chakshi
npm start
```

### Or run both together:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 4.3 Verify Server Health

### Check if backend is running:
Visit: http://localhost:3001/health

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T...",
  "uptime": 123.456,
  "environment": "development"
}
```

### Check API endpoints:
Visit: http://localhost:3001/

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Legal Platform Payment API",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "endpoints": {
    "health": "/health",
    "createOrder": "POST /api/create-order",
    "verifyPayment": "POST /api/verify-payment",
    "paymentStatus": "GET /api/payment-status/:paymentId",
    "webhook": "POST /api/razorpay-webhook"
  }
}
```

## 4.4 Test Payment Flow

### Step 1: Access Pricing Page
1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to pricing section
3. Verify all three pricing cards are displayed correctly

### Step 2: Initiate Payment
1. Click "Get Started" on any plan
2. Verify loading state appears
3. Check browser console for any errors

### Step 3: Complete Test Payment
When Razorpay modal opens, use these **test card details**:

#### ‚úÖ Successful Payment Test:
```
Card Number: 4111 1111 1111 1111
Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
CVV: Any 3-digit number (e.g., 123)
Name: Test User
```

#### ‚ùå Failed Payment Test:
```
Card Number: 4000 0000 0000 0002
Expiry: Any future date
CVV: Any 3-digit number
Name: Test User
```

#### üîÑ Other Test Scenarios:
```
# Insufficient funds
Card Number: 4000 0000 0000 0069

# Card declined
Card Number: 4000 0000 0000 0119

# Invalid card
Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4241
```
